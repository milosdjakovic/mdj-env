# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

macOS development environment bootstrap and dotfiles management using GNU Stow. All dotfiles are symlinked from `dotfiles/` to `$HOME` via stow.

## Commands

```bash
# Full setup (run once on new machine)
./setup.sh

# Run individual setup scripts
./src/install-homebrew.sh
./src/install-homebrew-packages.sh
./src/install-ohmyzsh.sh
./src/install-ohmyzsh-plugins.sh
./src/install-tmux-plugins.sh
./src/setup-stow-dotfiles.sh
./src/setup-zshrc.sh
./src/bootstrap-nvim.sh
./src/setup-dev-defaults.sh

# Set default editor for dev file types manually (setup-dev-defaults.sh defaults to Zed)
./src/set-dev-defaults.sh "Zed"
./src/set-dev-defaults.sh "Visual Studio Code"

# Manual stow operations (from dotfiles/ directory)
cd dotfiles
stow -t ~ <package>           # Symlink a package
stow -t ~ --adopt <package>   # Adopt existing files and symlink
stow -D -t ~ <package>        # Unlink a package
```

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

- `setup.sh` - Main orchestrator that runs all scripts in sequence
- `Brewfile` - Homebrew packages and casks
- `src/` - Modular setup scripts (all idempotent, support Apple Silicon and Intel)
- `dotfiles/` - Stow-managed configurations, each subdirectory is a stow package

### Stow Packages

**Stowed by default:** ghostty, tmux, nvim, zsh, hammerspoon, claude, lf, lazygit

**Available but not stowed:** alacritty, kitty, wezterm

Each package mirrors the home directory structure (e.g., `dotfiles/nvim/.config/nvim/` → `~/.config/nvim/`)

### Claude Code

Configuration in `dotfiles/claude/.claude/` (stow managed):
- `commands/` - Custom slash commands (e.g., `/commit`)
- `statusline-command.sh` - Custom status line script

`settings.json` is not tracked in the repo because Claude Code modifies it directly.

### Hammerspoon

Configuration in `dotfiles/hammerspoon/.hammerspoon/`:
- `init.lua` - Entry point, orchestrates all Spoons
- `config/` - User-editable configuration (pure data)
  - `apps.lua` - App bundle ID registry
  - `keys.lua` - All keybinding definitions
  - `settings.lua` - Global settings (margins, timing)
  - `workspaces/` - Workspace definitions (dev.lua, vicert.lua)
- `Spoons/` - Real Hammerspoon Spoons (reusable logic)
  - HyperKey, HyperCheatSheet, AppToggler, WindowManager, StageManager, WorkspaceEngine, TerminalHandler, DockMenuToggle

Caps Lock is the Hyper key. `src/setup-capslock-hyper.sh` remaps Caps Lock → F18
via `hidutil` (LaunchAgent, ~0 RAM); `HyperKey.spoon` uses an `hs.eventtap` to
dispatch **hold F18 + letter** to app toggles and **quick tap** to
`hs.hid.capslock.toggle()`. No Karabiner or extra daemon. Raw Caps Lock can't be
used directly (toggle key emits no key up/down); a real modifier can't either
(its flag stamps every keystroke) — hence the F18 remap. Holding ~0.6s with no
key fires `HyperKey`'s `onHold` → `HyperCheatSheet`, an overlay of the bindings
split into open vs not-running apps (uninstalled/unresolvable apps filtered out;
names+icons cached at load, only the running split recomputed per show).

Coupling is contained: `HyperKey` is an optional injected dependency of
`AppToggler` only. If it is not wired up in `init.lua`, `AppToggler` falls back
to binding the literal `HYPER` (⇧⌃⌥⌘) combo from `keys.lua` — so removing the
Hyper key degrades gracefully, it does not break other spoons. Trade-offs: the
remap is machine-wide (Caps Lock is F18 in every app), and Caps Lock toggling
depends on Hammerspoon running. Undo steps are in `src/setup-capslock-hyper.sh`.

Config auto-reloads when files change. Get app bundle ID: `osascript -e 'id of app "APP_NAME"'`

### Tmux

Configuration in `dotfiles/tmux/`. See `dotfiles/tmux/CLAUDE.md` for binding conventions, priority system, scoped fzf switchers, popup workarounds, and status bar details.

### lf

Configuration in `dotfiles/lf/`. See `dotfiles/lf/CLAUDE.md` for why lf was chosen over yazi, the tmux popup nesting limitation, command type differences, and custom keybinding details.

### Neovim

LazyVim-based configuration. Run `nvim` after setup to bootstrap plugins.
